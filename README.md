# react-text-area
this is my implementation of a text area component


## Criterias
- [ ] if the max rows was not reached, there should always be an empty line at the bottom (component should resize according to line wrapping)
- [x] line breaks should work on enter
- [x] word wrapping should not break words
- [ ] component's underline should be highlighted while input is focused
- [x] component should have a placeholder
