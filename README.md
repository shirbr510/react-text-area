# react-text-area
this is my implementation of a text area component


## Criterias
- [x] if the max rows was not reached, there should always be an empty line at the bottom (component should resize according to line wrapping)
- [x] line breaks should work on enter
- [x] word wrapping should not break words
- [x] component's underline should be highlighted while input is focused
- [x] component should have a placeholder

## Getting Started

1. make sure you have storybook installed globally by running `npm i -g @storybook/cli`
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run storybook`
4. start checking it out ðŸŽ‰


## Future Milestones

- [ ] support external classnames easely
- [ ] support external styles easely
- [ ] support different focus highlight styles via style object and css
